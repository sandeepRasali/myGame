# myGame


Hi! My name is Sandeep Rasali and this is my repository where I am going to build a basic game using turtle library of python. 
The name of my Game is AirStrike. This is my first time creating actually a game with coding. I don't have prior coding experience. 
I would really apprecaite the feedback on my code. 
Thank you!
